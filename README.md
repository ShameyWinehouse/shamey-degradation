# shamey-degradation

A free, open-source RedM script for degrading weapons & holdables

## Features
- Built-in support for detecting use of lassoes (plain & reinforced), fishing rods, torches, bows, & melee weapons
- Configurable (thresholds, intervals, damage rates)
- Performant

## Requirements
- VORP Framework
- [shamey-core](https://github.com/ShameyWinehouse/shamey-core)
  - NOTE: `shamey-core` does all the actual degradation logic. This script (`shamey-degradation`) just detects and reports the usage of certain weapons/holdables back to `shamey-core`'s degradation system.
